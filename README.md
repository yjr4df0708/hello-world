# hello-world
This is for anything I want to store here that I won't put in its own repository.

Currently the only thing here is an interpreter built with flex and bison. It is supposed to be used as an alternative to, or in combination with regular macros, but able to do more and be more easily extensible.

None of the macros are actually run yet, just checked. The main problem is that it doesn't like integers, and will vaguely error out with "syntax error". The integers were implemented in the same way as doubles were, which work correctly.
